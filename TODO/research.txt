GOAL: We need to get a sense of what "typical" problems are for beginners trying to use sklearn.
OUTCOME: A text file with examples of common mistakes. There should be links to examples. There
should be a clear sense of which mistakes are most commonly experienced.

SUGGESTIONS: Trawl Kaggle and Stack Overflow.
Look through sklearn's documentation and write down stuff that they call out.
Read through ML textbooks (I'm thinking like kjell's book on data transformations?) and
see if there are any "obvious best practices" that we could call out.
Look up tutorials online, see what suggestions they offer.
