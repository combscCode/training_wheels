# Tenents

Training wheels do not stop you from riding into oncoming traffic. Similarly,
this package cannot prevent all mistakes when using sklearn. However, it does
try to put boundaries around certain classes of problems. Problems that
the average beginner will likely fall into, and is likely to not even realize
that they've fallen into it.


The goal of this package is to stop you from shooting yourself in the foot.
It is not meant to be a guide for how to learn Machine Learning, textbooks
and classes are far better tools.

This package will not give you recommendations on which approaches are best
for a certain ML problem. It will just let you know if you're doing something
Really Dumb. If you're doing something Really Dumb, you're doing something that
no sane person would ever want to do. You're probably breaking fundamental
assumptions that need to hold for the model you're using. Really Dumb mistakes
should be avoided at all costs.

Training Wheels hopes to let you know when you're doing something Really Dumb.
That's it. Nothing more, nothing less.
